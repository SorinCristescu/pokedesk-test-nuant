## Getting Started

First clone the repository

Then install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you can run the project locally in development mode with live reload by executing:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

The project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing. You can run the tests with:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
# or
bun test
```

Run test in watch all mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
# or
yarn test:watch
# or
pnpm test:watch
# or
bun test:watch
```

Run lint:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
# or
pnpm lint
# or
bun lint
```

Run format with prettier:

```bash
npm run format
# or
yarn format
# or
pnpm format
# or
bun format
```

The project enforces Conventional Commits specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses Commitizen, an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```bash
npm run commit
# or
yarn commit
# or
pnpm commit
# or
bun commit
```
One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a CHANGELOG file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
